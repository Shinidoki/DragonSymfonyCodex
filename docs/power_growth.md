# Power, Growth & Limits

**Design Document**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines how **power** functions in the game world: how it is gained, perceived, limited, and lost over time.

Power is not treated as a static value or a progression bar. Instead, it is a **dynamic, contextual expression** of a character’s physical, mental, and spiritual development, inspired by the internal logic of the **Dragon Ball (Z / GT / Super)**.

The goal is to create a system where:

* Growth feels earned
* Limits feel natural
* Power creates consequences rather than solving problems permanently

---

## 2. Power Level as a Derived Value

A character does not directly possess a “power level” as a primary stat.

Instead:

* **Power Level is a derived value**
* It is calculated from a character’s underlying stats and current condition

Factors influencing power level include:

* Physical attributes
* Ki capacity and control
* Efficiency and mastery
* Injuries, fatigue, and emotional state
* Active transformations or enhancements

Power level is therefore:

* Dynamic
* Context-sensitive
* Capable of changing rapidly under certain conditions

---

## 3. Perception of Power

Power is not always visible or reliably measurable.

### 3.1 Technological Measurement

Special equipment (e.g. scouters) can display:

* A **numeric power level**

These readings:

* Represent technological measurement, not intuition
* May be unreliable at extreme values
* Can fail or overflow when power exceeds expected ranges

Exact power values are never available by default.

---

### 3.2 Aura Sensing

Aura sensing is a **learned ability**, not an innate one.

Once acquired, it allows a character to perceive:

* Whether another being is weaker
* Roughly equal in strength
* Stronger

Key principles:

* Aura sensing does not reveal exact numbers
* Precision improves with training
* Certain energies may be difficult or impossible to read

Aura sensing is generally easier to learn than power suppression.

---

### 3.3 Visual Judgment

Without sensing or technology:

* The player relies on descriptive observation

Descriptions are based on:

* Apparent age
* Physique
* Behavior
* Confidence and presence

Visual judgment can be misleading.
Appearances do not reliably indicate true strength.

---

## 4. Suppressing Power

Suppressing one’s power is a **trained skill**.

Key rules:

* Power suppression does not exist at character creation
* It may emerge naturally as Ki control improves
* Mastery requires deliberate training

Suppression allows a character to:

* Mask their true strength
* Appear weaker than they are
* Avoid detection or unwanted attention

Learning to sense power often precedes learning to suppress it.

---

## 5. Power Growth Philosophy

### 5.1 Growth Through Experience

Power increases through:

* Training
* Combat
* Survival
* Mentorship
* Exposure to extreme conditions

There is no global experience system.
Growth occurs organically through action and risk.

---

### 5.2 Asymptotic Growth

Power growth is not linear.

* Early gains are relatively fast
* Growth slows as characters approach their personal limits
* Most characters never reach their theoretical maximum

This creates natural power hierarchies within the world.

---

### 5.3 Stress as a Catalyst

Safe training produces diminishing returns.

Major breakthroughs often require:

* Risk
* Failure
* Injury
* Emotional strain
* Near-death experiences

Power without struggle is rare and often unstable.

---

## 6. Power Loss and Decay

Power is not permanently fixed.

It may **slightly decrease** due to:

* Extended periods without training or combat
* Temporary injuries
* Aging (race-dependent)

Design constraints:

* Power decay is slow and forgiving
* Players should not feel punished for inactivity
* Temporary losses are recoverable

---

### 6.1 Injuries

* Minor injuries cause temporary power loss
* Serious injuries (e.g. loss of limbs) cause lasting impact
* Some injuries may never fully heal without intervention

---

### 6.2 Aging

Aging affects races differently.

* Aging may reduce adaptability and recovery
* Aging effects can be delayed or mitigated through:

    * Techniques
    * Magic
    * Technology

Immortality or longevity comes with its own risks and trade-offs.

---

## 7. Limits and Soft Caps

All power limits are **soft caps**.

* Growth slows dramatically near a character’s ceiling
* Growth never fully stops
* Exceptional circumstances can raise limits

Ways to raise soft caps include:

* Advanced training methods
* Transformations
* Rituals or divine intervention
* Artificial enhancement
* Rare world events

No character has an absolute, unbreakable ceiling.

---

## 8. Transformations and Long-Term Growth

Transformations primarily:

* Temporarily increase stats
* Bypass certain limits at a cost

Most transformations:

* Do not directly raise base power permanently

However:

* Training while transformed may be more efficient
* Some transformations grant small long-term growth bonuses

Transformations are tools for both combat and development, but carry risk.

---

## 9. Artificial Enhancement and Trade-offs

Artificial modifications interact with power in different ways.

Possible effects include:

* Raising the power ceiling
* Increasing base power to a fixed level
* Reducing long-term growth potential

Examples:

* Serums may raise maximum potential
* Mechanical limbs may boost power for weaker characters
* Powerful characters may lose potential by replacing superior natural biology

Enhancements are contextual, irreversible, and situational.

---

## 10. Imperfect Information

No perception system is flawless.

Aura sensing may be unreliable when:

* Power is heavily suppressed
* Energy is artificial or unstable
* Divine forces are involved

Androids often emit little or no readable aura.

Uncertainty is an intentional design feature.

---

## 11. World Reaction to Power

The world responds to significant power growth.

Possible reactions include:

* Political attention
* Fear-driven coalitions
* Faction intervention
* Divine observation or interference

Power attracts pressure, conflict, and consequence.

---

## 12. Summary

* Power level is derived, dynamic, and contextual
* Growth is earned through struggle and experience
* Limits exist but can be pushed
* Information about power is imperfect
* The world reacts to power, not the player

Power is not the end goal.
**Legacy is.**
