# Races & Techniques – Design Overview

## 1. Design Intent

Races and techniques in this project are not simple character options or abilities.
They are **fundamental properties of the world**, governed by the internal logic of the Dragon Ball universe.

The goal is to:

* Preserve canon consistency
* Enable procedural storytelling
* Support long-term world simulation
* Avoid “build menus” and hard class boundaries

Races define **biological and metaphysical potential**, while techniques define **learned expression of power**.

---

## 2. Races: General Principles

* Races determine **growth curves**, **limits**, and **natural affinities**
* No race guarantees success or dominance
* Power is contextual and situational
* Racial advantages always come with constraints
* NPCs and the player follow the same racial rules

Races are chosen at birth and cannot normally be changed, with the notable exception of **artificial modification**.

---

## 3. Playable & Simulated Races

### 3.1 Saiyan

**Core Identity**

* Combat-driven species with extreme growth potential
* Emotional intensity strongly tied to power

**Defining Traits**

* Rapid growth through battle
* Near-death survival leading to permanent strength increase
* Strong emotional triggers

**Narrative Role**

* High-risk, high-reward race
* Prone to explosive rises and catastrophic falls
* Often central to world-altering conflicts

Saiyans are not inherently heroic or villainous; their culture and experiences shape them.

---

### 3.2 Human

**Core Identity**

* Physically limited but highly adaptable
* Masters of efficiency and technique

**Defining Traits**

* Slower raw power growth
* Faster mastery of techniques
* Lower energy waste
* High creativity in combat

**Narrative Role**

* Underdogs and specialists
* Often influential through strategy, leadership, or innovation
* Capable of rivaling stronger races through skill and preparation

Humans excel in longevity, refinement, and legacy-building.

---

### 3.3 Namekian

**Core Identity**

* Spiritually advanced, biologically resilient beings

**Defining Traits**

* Natural regeneration
* Strong connection to spiritual and mystical forces
* Ability to merge with others of their kind

**Narrative Role**

* Guardians, sages, and survivors
* Often central to planetary or cultural preservation
* Long-lived, with deep historical impact

Namekians tend to influence the world quietly but profoundly.

---

### 3.4 Majin

**Core Identity**

* Unstable, malleable beings shaped by emotion and consumption

**Defining Traits**

* Extreme regeneration
* Ability to absorb others
* Personality volatility

**Narrative Role**

* Wildcards of the world
* Can become saviors, destroyers, or something in between
* Highly unpredictable in long-term simulation

Majins are rare and often feared due to their chaotic nature.

---

## 4. Androids: A Special Case

Androids are **not a starting race**.

They are the result of **in-world modification** performed by scientists.

**Key Principles**

* Becoming an android is a life-altering event
* It may be voluntary or forced
* It carries irreversible consequences

Androidification replaces or alters biology rather than redefining birth.

---

### 4.1 Android Identity

Androids exist in several broad forms:

* Energy-absorbing models
* Infinite-energy models
* Bio-modified organic androids

Regardless of form:

* Androids gain stability and endurance
* Spiritual growth is limited or altered
* Some abilities may become inaccessible

Androids are often feared, hunted, or politically exploited.

---

## 5. Techniques: General Philosophy

Techniques are **learned expressions of Ki**, not innate powers.

Key rules:

* Techniques must be learned, taught, or discovered
* No technique is race-exclusive unless canon supports it
* Techniques improve through use and training
* NPCs and the player use the same technique system

A technique is not just an attack—it is a discipline.

---

## 6. Technique Categories

### 6.1 Energy Techniques

Techniques that project or shape Ki:

* Beam attacks
* Explosive blasts
* Piercing attacks

These techniques vary in:

* Charge time
* Energy efficiency
* Accuracy
* Destructive potential

Famous techniques may gain reputations within the world.

---

### 6.2 Utility Techniques

Non-damaging or indirectly damaging abilities:

* Movement techniques
* Sensory disruption
* Defensive maneuvers

Utility techniques often define a fighter’s identity more than raw power.

---

### 6.3 Enhancement Techniques

Techniques that temporarily alter performance:

* Power amplification
* Speed boosts
* Focused states

These techniques are inherently dangerous and require discipline to use safely.

---

## 7. Technique Evolution

Techniques are not static.

Over time, a technique may:

* Become more efficient
* Charge faster
* Cause less strain
* Be adapted to the user’s fighting style

However:

* The core identity of the technique remains intact
* Techniques do not change elemental nature or canon logic

A technique’s history may outlive its creator.

---

## 8. Relationship Between Race & Technique

Race influences:

* How easily techniques are learned
* How efficiently Ki is used
* How dangerous certain techniques are

However:

* No race has exclusive ownership over skill
* Technique mastery can overcome racial disadvantages
* Poor technique use can nullify racial advantages

This ensures balance through **context, not numbers**.

---

## 9. Summary

* Races define potential, not destiny
* Techniques define expression, not raw strength
* Androids are a transformation of existence, not a race
* Canon rules guide all systems
* The world treats player characters and NPCs equally

Together, races and techniques form the **foundation of identity** in a living Dragon Ball–inspired world.
