# Transformations

**Design Document (Revised)**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines how **transformations** function in the game:
how they are unlocked, used, trained, and how they interact with character stats, power growth, and combat flow.

Transformations are designed as **temporary power states** that trade short-term dominance for **post-use vulnerability**, closely following the internal logic of the **Dragon Ball (Z / GT / Super)**.

They are powerful tools — not permanent upgrades, and not long-term punishments.

---

## 2. Core Design Principles

1. **Transformations are temporary states, not permanent changes**
2. **Most transformations are safe if used correctly**
3. **Overuse causes short-term exhaustion, not permanent damage**
4. **Mastery reduces drawbacks, not removes them**
5. **Only specific transformations carry true physical risk**

---

## 3. What a Transformation Is

A transformation is a **temporary combat and performance state** that:

* Boosts core attributes
* Increases derived stats (including power level)
* Drains Ki continuously
* Overrides some soft caps temporarily

While transformed, the character operates at a higher output than their base form allows.

---

## 4. Unlocking Transformations

Transformations are unlocked through **exceptional in-world circumstances**, not menus.

Common triggers include:

* Extreme training stress
* Breakthrough moments
* Near-death survival
* Rituals or special instruction
* Prolonged failure followed by adaptation

Unlocking a transformation is a **major milestone**, but not inherently dangerous.

---

## 5. Transformation Duration & Safety

Each transformation has a **safe operating window**.

* Using the form within this window:

    * Causes normal Ki drain
    * Leaves the character tired but functional
* Exceeding the safe duration:

    * Rapidly drains Ki
    * Causes severe exhaustion after reversion
    * May temporarily weaken the character

This creates a clear tactical question:

> *Do I end the fight now, or risk being helpless afterward?*

---

## 6. Post-Transformation Exhaustion (Primary Drawback)

The main downside of transformations is **post-use exhaustion**, not long-term harm.

After reverting, the character may suffer:

* Reduced Ki regeneration
* Lower physical efficiency
* Slower reactions
* Temporary stat penalties
* Inability to re-transform immediately

These effects:

* Are temporary
* Scale with overuse
* Recover naturally over time

This preserves tension without punishing experimentation.

---

## 7. Transformation Control & Mastery

Transformations are not binary.

Each form progresses through **control stages**:

* **Unstable** – high drain, short safe duration
* **Controlled** – manageable drain, predictable limits
* **Mastered** – reduced drain, longer safe window
* **Refined** (rare) – near-instant activation, minimal waste

Mastery:

* Extends safe duration
* Reduces post-use exhaustion
* Improves efficiency
* Does *not* remove trade-offs entirely

---

## 8. Training While Transformed

Training while transformed is:

* More exhausting
* More demanding
* More efficient

Benefits:

* Faster stat growth in relevant areas
* Faster mastery of the transformation
* Slight long-term efficiency gains

Risks:

* Severe short-term fatigue
* Increased downtime
* Possible training interruption

This makes transformation training a **strategic choice**, not a default.

---

## 9. Transformations with True Physical Risk (Exceptions)

Some transformations **break the general rule** and carry real physical danger.

Example: **Kaioken**

* Multiplies output beyond safe biological limits
* Using high levels or extended duration may cause:

    * Internal damage
    * Temporary stat loss
    * Severe injury if abused

These transformations are:

* Clearly signposted
* Rare
* High-skill tools
* Optional paths for risk-tolerant players

Most transformations do **not** behave this way.

---

## 10. Interaction with Artificial Enhancement

Artificial modifications may affect transformations:

* Some enhancements reduce Ki drain
* Others interfere with biological transformation processes
* Full androidification typically replaces biological transformations with alternative states

However:

* Most standard transformations remain safe unless explicitly stated otherwise

---

## 11. Perception & World Reaction

Transformations are **highly visible** events.

Effects include:

* Sharp increases in perceived power
* Aura flares
* Environmental reactions

World responses may include:

* Fear or awe
* Tactical retreat
* Faction interest
* Divine observation

Using a transformation is a declaration of intent.

---

## 12. Transformations & Legacy

A character’s mastery of transformations influences how they are remembered:

* Efficient users are respected
* Reckless users are infamous
* Masters may become teachers
* Failed users may be cautionary tales

Legacy is shaped by **how transformations were used**, not just which ones were unlocked.

---

## 13. Summary

* Transformations provide powerful short-term boosts
* The main cost is **post-use exhaustion**
* Mastery reduces, but never removes, drawbacks
* Only specific transformations carry long-term physical risk
* Transformations reward skillful timing, not constant use

Transformations are not punishments.
They are **tools that demand judgment**.
